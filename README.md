## Brief
**2. Data Explorer**  
Note: I will cover SQL database connection (briefly) in class.  

Data analysis is a major area within Computer Science. Apart from the Big Data generated by social
media and internet generally – there is an insatiable desire on behalf of companies to analyse their
data in order to reveal “knowledge” hidden in the data. For example, an Optical chain analysed
their sales data to determine that sales of high-end high-profit glasses peaked on Friday afternoons –
so they made sure that they had enough staff to service this demand.  

The Irish Government have put 1000s of datasets into public use at a portal site:
[https://data.gov.ie/data](https://data.gov.ie/data)

This has data about a whole plethora of public interests and government control information e.g.
about crime rates, hospitals, schools, transport, environment, energy use and so on.

The purpose of this project is to take **ONE** of these datasets – and build a tool that shows interesting
facts from the dataset. The dataset formats include Comma Separated (CSV) which is probably the
easier to work at – so these datasets are at: https://data.gov.ie/data/search?res_format=CSV

You don’t have to use the full dataset if it is too big. But to query it, you will need to LOAD the
dataset, or a subset of it, into a relational database yourself – and get a connection working between
your java code and the database (using JDBC).

You could also just read in the file and do simple operations on it (e.g. how many of ??).. but
searching is very limited if you stick just to file format without a database.

Your project will need to have a GUI that allows query parameters to be put in.

**Extras**
- Ability to see the results through the GUI too.
- Flexible queries – not just one or two hardcoded
- Whatever else you decide might enhance the application

## Overview
The program is designed to allow a user to launch the application, import their cleaned data of the [TFI Bus Stops](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/b61d8abf-efd1-4476-a29b-afc8c2edd6ba/resource/6db74b2d-c7d3-4faf-a922-851c042715ba) and see filtered views with row counts on each query  
The user can also configure their required settings to connect to their own database. (_Note there is no remote database connection available for demo_)

## Classes
### Control
This class was used to initiate the program by creating a new GUI
```java
new GUI();
```

### GUI
This class is where the user interacts with the program  
It primarily operates off of;
- 11 Buttons for various actions
- 1 Table to display the users content and queries
- 2 Text fields/areas for user input and system output
- 1 Checkbox for additional usability  

Each attribute is declared and all names are easily understandable
```java
private JLabel lbTitle;
private JTable tbTable;
private JTextField tfFilter;
private JButton btFilter;
private JButton btClearDB;
private JButton btPullDB;
private JButton btSelectFile;
private JButton btImportFile;
private JCheckBox cbHeader;
private JButton btQuit;
private JButton btAdmin;
private JButton btStop;
private JButton btNameLocal;
private JButton btLocality;
private JButton btName;
private JTextArea taOutput;
```
Each attribute is placed in the GUI through the use of the `GridBagLayout`  
Then each button has an `ActionListener` that will call on other classes to trigger a function


### Admin
This class is where the user interacts with the database configurations of the program
The user simply has access to configure;  
- Domain
- Port
- Username
- Password
- Database (_Name_)
- Table (_Name_)  

Once the user is happy they can save the settings and close the window  
The program will then generate the correct connection details and will dynamically alter an _SQL_ queries to match the settings eg
```java
connect = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbc:mysql://localhost:8889/java, Eoghan, letmein);
```  

### ConnectionInfo
This class is primarily a holding point for all the _"global variables"_ if you will  
This is just where the individual variables of admin settings are held

### Erase Data
This class is used to erase the contents of the database entirely  
It does this by connecting to the database and executing the line of _SQL_  
``` SQL
DELETE FROM `assignment` WHERE `StopNumber` > 0
```  
This removes everything in the database as there is no stop numbers 0

### Filter
